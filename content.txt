Stocks for Noobs

Intro
=====
When you see “stock” think “part owner" of a company. Stock is an ownership stake in a corporation. A company’s stocks, or shares, are a way to keep track of the ownership of the company. If a company has issued 100,000 shares of stock, each individual share represents 1/100,000th of that company. These shares can be traded among investors. The trading process is very simple for companies that are publicly traded, meaning capable of being bought and sold " a market" by anyone through a stock exchange (a market for trading stocks).

Individual investors are mostly interested in publicly traded stocks. Private companies — a small business accros town, for example — may be a corporation with stock, but only a few people are involved in the business and it’s very difficult to buy and sell shares of ownership. Publicly traded stocks are a simple way to have a "share of ownership" in a business and to benefit from its profits. You can own a share of the company without having any involvement in the day-to-day operations — and you can sell your shares to trade them in for cash at any time.
